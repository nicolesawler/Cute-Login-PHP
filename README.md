## Challenge two:

### Summary:

Help! a bunch of customers can't log in to our site! We need you to figure out why and fix it ASAP!

### Requirements:

- PHP 7+
- Mysql 8+
### Setup:

- Ensure all dependencies are installed. E.g: `php-mysql`.
- import the provided SQL dump file located in the `database` directory.
